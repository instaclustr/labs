Cite the evidence that supports each factual paragraph. Every current price, number, date, percentage, ratio, ticker, or named financial metric must have an inline citation. You may group citations, for example [F1, M1]. Never cite an ID absent from the evidence. State missing, stale, or conflicting evidence plainly.

## Financial assessment
Answer the requested financial question directly.

## Evidence limits
Describe material limits, or write "None identified."

Do not create a Sources section or an Audit ID. The application adds both from the approved evidence registry.
